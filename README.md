## ðŸ“‹ Nodes

### Models
- **Load Diffusion Model with Name** - Return diffusion model and model name. The name can be used when saving files to understand which model was used in creation.
- **Load UNet Model with Name** - Return UNet model and model name. The name can be used when saving files to understand which model was used in creation.
- **Load Checkpoint Model with Name** - Return components of a checkpoint model and its name. The name can be used when saving files to understand which model was used in creation.
- **Load LoRA with Name** - Return LoRA model and LoRA name. The name can be used when saving files to understand which LoRA was used in creation.

### Video
- **Save Frame** - Save individual frames with sequential numbering. Useful for extracting specific frames from video for processing.
- **Save Video Images** - Batch save multiple images as numbered sequence. Allows decomposing video into images, modifying some frames, then reassembling into video.

### Image
- **Save Static Image** - Save images with quality control, metadata, and an option to skip existing files. Allows saving images using filesystem paths.
- **Load Image if Exist** - Load images with existence check, returning a boolean status. Loads image by filesystem path and returns boolean to check if image was loaded.
- **Image Filter Loader** - Batch load images from folders with filtering + returns number of found images and their paths. Loads images from a folder whose names contain the filter keyword.
- **Stroke RGBA Image** - Add customizable stroke effects to RGBA images or by mask. Preserves alpha channel after stroking.
- **Create RGBA Image** - Generate transparent or colored RGBA image. Useful for compositing images from different layers.
- **Add Layer Overlay** - Composite layers with positioning, rotation and opacity control.
- **Get One Alpha Layer** - Extract the largest alpha region from images.
- **Get All Alpha Layers** - Extract all significant alpha regions while preserving smaller details.

### Upscale
- **Topaz Photo AI** - Integrate with Topaz Photo AI for professional upscaling with autopilot settings. Compression parameter controls PNG compression after upscaling. tpai_exe specifies path to folder containing tpai.exe file. For custom settings, configure AutoPilot mode in Topaz Photo AI preferences.

### Text
- **Get Text From List by Index** - Extract specific text items from lists or string lists by index position.
- **Text Saver** - Save text to file by path. Useful for saving translations or configuration sets.
- **Get Substring** - Extract substrings with start position, length and reverse options. Useful for trimming long model names when saving results.
- **Model Name to Key** - Convert model filenames to clean keys. Cuts beginning and end of text to create keys from these parts.
- **Text to MD5** - Generate MD5 hashes from text for unique identifiers.
- **Join Strings** - Concatenate multiple strings with custom delimiters. Text can be written directly in the node.
- **Get Timestamp** - Generate current timestamp strings for file naming.

### Logic
- **Switch Integer** - Convert ON/OFF states to 1/0 integers for conditional logic.
- **Switch Index** - Convert ON/OFF states to 2/1 indices for node switching.
- **Get Models** - Get model list by search key. In test mode, uses next model from list each run (very convenient for model testing). In work mode, uses only model from model_name or first in list.

### System
- **Bridge All** - Simple bridge with main parameters.
- **Queue Stop** - Stop processing with optional sound alerts and queue clearing.
- **Create Folder** - Create directory by path programmatically.
